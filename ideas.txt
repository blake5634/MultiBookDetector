1) hough-transform - find lines, esp. vertical ones
2) color blobs - select book-like shapes ("booktangles") from VQ-labeled centroid color blobs
3) slants - find lines with big gradients across them (at various angles)
4) "Educate" a deep NN with progressions of synthetic images of increasing difficulty
5) drop down contour from background at top of image, also up from bottom of image
6) develop a "corner-finder" look for quads of 4 similar corners.  Concentrate corner search along top/bottom bg contours.
